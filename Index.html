			<h3><strong>Who is Varun Mayya?</strong></h3>
			<p>
				Varun Mayya is an entrepreneur, venture capitalist, neuroeconomist, computer scientist, blockchain
				Pioneer
				aspiring oncologist and CRISPR enthusiast. A lot of things have been achieved by him at a very young
				age.
				<br>
				<br>
				Varun Mayya's entrepreneural journey started when he was pursuing his bachelors degree from Manipal
				Institute of
				Technlogy. When he was in his first year of college, Varun started with a t-shirts start-up. Then he
				began freelancing
				and when he was in his final year at MIT he founded a recruitment platform named SIZR.
				<br>
				<br>
				He is the youngest venture capitalist. He is currently the CEO at Avalon Labs which is a holdings
				company.
				<br>
				<br>
				He is trying to bring a change in the education system by empowering everyone with quality education for
				free at his
				new venture known as meta. Although it is still in beta stage. Though I could not get access to it but
				there
				has been a lot of buzz in his telegram group. As Varun said that the meta platform is designed to be
				entertaining and not
				boring like the traditional education system.
				<br>
				<br>

			</p>
			<h3><strong>What is meta?</strong></h3>
			<p>
				Varun is trying to gamify education by creating teams, and levels. Students can choose their mentors.
				For business they
				have to opt for Varun Mayya, coding - Jasneet Singh Sawhney, marketing - Abhinav Arora and Finance -
				Sashank Udupa. Varun
				once mentioned in an interview that he will be using horse blinders so that the users can stick to one
				category. After they
				reach a certaon level they will be allowed to access other categories. In this way it will help the
				users as they will not be jumping
				from one skill to the other. This will enable the users to learn a particular skill properly before they
				can start learning a new skill.
